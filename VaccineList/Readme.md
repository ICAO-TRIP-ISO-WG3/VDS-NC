 Vaccine List
</h1>

As per the specifications for VDS-NC, there are three fields that identify the vaccine:

Vaccine/prophylaxis (ICD-11 extension code) -> encoded as 'des'

Medicinal Product name -> encoded as 'nam'

Disease or agent targeted -> encoded as 'dis'

To ensure interoperability and wider acceptance of VDS-NC, it is necessary to harmonise the values in these fields. The schema "vaccineListSchema.json" specifies the values of these three fields for the vaccines that have been approved as part of the WHO EUL.
